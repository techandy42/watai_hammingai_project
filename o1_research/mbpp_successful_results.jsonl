Thus, `dp[1] = k`.\n3. **n = 2**: For two posts, you can paint them with the same color or different colors. The number of combinations will be `k + k*(k-1) = k*k`. Thus, `dp[2] = k*k`.\n\nRecursive Relations:\n1. For `n > 2`, the relationship can be established as follows:\n   - If the last two posts are of different colors, then the previous post can be any color, leading to `dp[n-1] * (k - 1)` options.\n   - If the last two posts are of the same color, then the color of the last post can only be the same as the second last, leading to `dp[n-2]` options.\n   - Therefore, the recursive formula is:\n   \n   `dp[n] = dp[n-1] * (k - 1) + dp[n-2] * (1)`  \n   \n   Where `dp[n]` counts the number of ways to paint `n` posts with the constraints.", "To define the base cases in our dynamic programming approach for counting valid painting configurations, we need to consider the simplest cases:\n\nBase Cases:\n1.

If there are two posts (n=2), we can paint them in k * k ways, since each post can be any of the k colors.\n\nFor recursive relationships:\n1. Let dp[i] be the number of ways to paint the fence with i posts.\n2. The last post can be painted in k ways. If the last post has a different color than the previous one, we can simply use dp[i-1]. \n3. If the last post has the same color as the previous one, it can only have the same color as the one before that (to not violate the condition of at most 2 adjacent posts with the same color). Thus, we can combine dp[i-1] only when the last and second last posts are different, followed by dp[i-2] when the last two are the same. \n4.
