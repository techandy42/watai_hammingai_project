This approach works correctly only when the result is a single-digit number, such as `2^3 = 8`. However, for results with multiple digits like `10^3 = 1000` or `12^2 = 144`, the function should return the sum of the digits (e.g., `1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1` and `1 + 4 + 4 = 9`) instead of the numerical value itself.
