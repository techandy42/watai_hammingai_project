Assuming `s` is your string and `char` is the character to be removed, you can do the following:

1. Find the index of the first occurrence: `first_index = s.index(char)`.
2. Find the index of the last occurrence: `last_index = s.rindex(char)`.
3. Construct a new string by concatenating the substring before the first occurrence and the substring after the last occurrence:
   
   ```python
   new_string = s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
   ```

This will effectively remove the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string. | You can use string slicing to remove the characters at the indices obtained for the first and last occurrences. Given a string `s`, if `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence, you can create a new string by concatenating the parts of the string before the first occurrence and after the last occurrence. The code would look like this:

```python
def remove_first_last(s, char):
    first_index = s.index(char)
    last_index = s.rindex(char)
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
``` | To remove the characters at the first and last occurrence indices from the string, you can use string slicing. You can take the part of the string before the first occurrence and concatenate it with the part of the string after the last occurrence. Here’s how you would do it:

Assuming `index_first` is the index of the first occurrence and `index_last` is the index of the last occurrence of the character `char`, you can use the following code:

```python
result = s[:index_first] + s[index_first + 1:index_last] + s[index_last + 1:]
```

This code removes the character at `index_first` and `index_last` by slicing the string appropriately. | To remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string using the indices obtained from the first and last occurrence, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the first index of the character using `index()` or `find()`. Let's call this `first_index`.
2. Identify the last index of the character using `rindex()` or `rfind()`. Let's call this `last_index`.
3. Create a new string that excludes the character at `first_index` and `last_index`.

Here’s a sample implementation:

```python
def remove_first_last_occurrence(s, char):
    first_index = s.index(char)  # First occurrence
    last_index = s.rindex(char)   # Last occurrence

    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]
```

In this implementation, we create a new string by slicing up to `first_index`, then skipping over the first occurrence of the character, between `first_index + 1` and `last_index`, excluding the last occurrence, and finally appending the remainder of the string starting from `last_index + 1`.",0,"To remove the characters at the indices obtained from the first and last occurrence of a given character in the string, you can use string slicing. Assuming `s` is your string and `char` is the character to be removed, you can do the following:

1. Find the index of the first occurrence: `first_index = s.index(char)`.
2. Find the index of the last occurrence: `last_index = s.rindex(char)`.
3. Construct a new string by concatenating the substring before the first occurrence and the substring after the last occurrence:
   
   ```python
   new_string = s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
   ```

This will effectively remove the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string."
