A simple approach is to use a flat rate, where the cost per unit of electricity consumed (in kWh) is multiplied by the total units consumed. For example, if the flat rate is $0.15 per kWh, the formula would be:\n\nBill = UnitsConsumed * RatePerUnit\n\nWhere 'UnitsConsumed' is the integer parameter passed to the function, and 'RatePerUnit' is a predefined constant value for the cost of electricity.", "The function should use a tiered pricing structure based on the amount of electricity consumed. For example:\n- For the first 100 kWh: $0.10 per kWh\n- For the next 100 kWh (101 to 200 kWh): $0.15 per kWh\n- For consumption above 200 kWh: $0.20 per kWh\nThis means that the first 100 kWh will cost $10, the next 100 kWh will cost $15, and any additional kWh will be charged at $0.20 per kWh, which should be summed to get the total bill.", "The electricity bill can be calculated using a tiered rate structure based on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed. For example:\n1. The first 100 kWh may be charged at $0.10 per kWh.\n2. The next 200 kWh (from 101 to 300 kWh) may be charged at $0.15 per kWh.\n3. Consumption above 300 kWh may be charged at $0.20 per kWh.\n\nThe formula for calculating the electricity bill can be structured as follows:\n- If consumption <= 100 kWh: bill = consumption * 0.10\n- If 100 < consumption <= 300 kWh: bill = (100 * 0.10) + ((consumption - 100) * 0.15)\n- If consumption > 300 kWh: bill = (100 * 0.10) + (200 * 0.15) + ((consumption - 300) * 0.20)", "The formula to calculate the electricity bill typically depends on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed. A common approach is to define a base rate and apply it to the consumed units. For example, a function could use the following simple tiered structure:\n\n1. First 100 kWh: $0.10/kWh\n2.
