The prefix sum is the maximum sum from the start of the array to any point, while the suffix sum is the maximum sum from any point to the end.\n\n3. **Evaluate the cases for repeated arrays:** When the array is repeated `k` times, consider the following cases based on the value of `k`:\n   - If `k = 1`: The answer is simply the maximum subarray sum from step 1.\n   - If `k = 2`: You can combine the suffix from the first array and the prefix from the second array.\n   - If `k > 2`: Combine the total sum from the original array multiplied by `(k - 2)`, along with the best prefix and best suffix sums.\n\n4. **Return the maximum found:** Compare and return the maximum of all calculated sums from the above steps.", "To find the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in a modified array formed by repeating a given array k times, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: You need to consider the original array first, then how it behaves when it is repeated.
