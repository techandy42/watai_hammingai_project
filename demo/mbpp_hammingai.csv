This function works by first checking if the number is less than 4. If it is, the function simply returns the number. If the number is 4 or greater, the function calculates the maximum sum by dividing the number into three parts as evenly as possible, then recursively calls itself on the remainder. This process continues until the number is less than 4. 

The line `n // 3 * 3` calculates the sum of the three parts, and `breakSum(n % 3)` calculates the sum of the remaining part. The `//` operator in Python performs integer division (i.e., division that ignores any remainder and returns the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are not taken into account). The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division."
